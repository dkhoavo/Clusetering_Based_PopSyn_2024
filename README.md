This code implements the simulation study of the paper, Vo et al. (2025). A novel data fusion method to leverage passively-collected mobility data in generating spatially-heterogeneous synthetic population. Transportation Research Part B. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2024.103128

Note:
1. The 'data' folder contains the sampled datasets for the simulation study.
2. The 'output' folder contains the fused distribution and simulated samples.
3. The results could differ slightly from those shown in the paper as these datasets are sampled randomly.
