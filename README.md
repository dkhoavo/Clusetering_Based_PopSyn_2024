This code implements the simulation study of the paper, Vo et al. (2025). A novel data fusion method to leverage passively-collected mobility data in generating spatially-heterogeneous synthetic population. Transportation Research Part B. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2024.103128

Note:
1. The 'data' folder contains the sampled datasets used in the simulation study, including 'data_hts_sim.csv' for HTS, 'data_cel_sim.csv' for PCM, and 'data_true_sim.csv' for the ground truth.
2. The 'output' folder contains the fused distribution, 'P_XYZ_sim.csv', and the population, 'sample_sim.csv', generated by running 'TRB_PopSyn.ipynb' file.
3. The results could differ slightly from those shown in the paper as these datasets are sampled randomly.
